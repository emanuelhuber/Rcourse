# Learn the very basics
1. **Recommanded:** Go to [tryr](http://tryr.codeschool.com), an online interactive course (that does not require any R installation). *Required time: about 40 min*
2. Have a look at this [R base cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/r-cheat-sheet-3.pdf)
 

<p class="message">Use the R-documentation
It is very helpful to check the documentation to know how to use a specific function:
```
?mean
```
Search the help files for a word or phrase. 
```
help.search("weighted mean")
```
