# Gettingy started

## R and RStudio installations (required)

1. **Install R Cran**
   - Go to the Comprehensive R Archive Network: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
   - If you are using windows, select the link "Download R for Windows"
   - Select the link "install R for the first time"
   - Select the link "Download R 3.4.3 for Windows" and install the executable
   
   Now R is installed on your machine. R can be run from the command prompt (open the command prompt, type `R` and press enter), but a simple GUI for R (`RGui`) was also installed along R. For beginners, it is recommanded to install `RStudio`, a free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for R.
   

2. **Install RStudio**
    - Go to the [download page of RStudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
    - Download RStudio for windows and install it
