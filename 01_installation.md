## Install R

- Go to the Comprehensive R Archive Network: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

Now R is installed on your machine. R can be run from the command prompt (open the command prompt, type `R` and press enter), but a simple GUI for R (`RGui`) was also installed along R. For beginners, it is recommanded to install `RStudio`, a free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for R.
